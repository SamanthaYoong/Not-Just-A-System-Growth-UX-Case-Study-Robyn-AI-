> A product growth case study focused on improving emotional resonance, onboarding experience, and user retention for a mental wellness AI journaling app designed for Gen Z.

## ðŸ’¡ Dashboard

In the middle of designing Tableau visualizations for retention and onboarding - still refining the dashboards!

## ðŸ’¡ Overview

This case study explores opportunities to optimize **Robyn AI's onboarding, conversation UX**, and **retention funnel**. While Robyn has strong potential in the mental wellness space, its current user experience risks early churn due to robotic tone and complex onboarding steps. I propose a more **emotionally humanized design** to better resonate with Gen Z users.

## ðŸ’¡ Problem Summary

### 1. First Impressions Matter
- **Issue**: Lengthy, text-heavy onboarding with too many questions up front.
- **Impact**: Users drop off before experiencing Robynâ€™s core value.
- **Suggestion**: Introduce Robyn *first* with a conversational or visual hook. Delay deeper setup until after value is shown.

### 2. Robotic vs. Human Tone
- **Issue**: Therapeutic conversation feels scripted, wordy, and automated.
- **Impact**: Low emotional resonance; users churn early or distrust the experience.
- **Suggestion**: Invest in humanized conversational AI. Train models using Gen Z tone, warmth, and brevity.

## ðŸ’¡ A/B Test Plan

### Goal: Improve activation and Day 1 retention by simplifying onboarding and humanizing tone.

| Variant | Onboarding | Tone Style         | Success Metrics                        |
|--------|------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------|
| A      | Current    | Robotic            | Baseline activation, D1 retention      |
| B      | Streamlined | Empathetic & Warm  | â†‘ Activation, â†‘ D1 retention, â†“ Churn  |

## ðŸ’¡ Funnel & Retention Analysis (Proposed)

Using mock or actual app data, I would build the following metrics via PostHog or Firebase:

### Key Funnel:
- **Signup â†’ Onboarding Start â†’ Journal Entry â†’ Return Visit (D1/D3/D7)**

### Retention Segments:
- **User Cohorts**: High usage vs. early churners  
- **Drop-off Points**: Long onboarding, robotic convo, low reply rate  
- **Emotional Triggers**: Which features lead to returns?

ðŸ“ˆ *Goal:* Identify what actions correlate with **ongoing journaling habit**, and design features to reinforce that behavior.

## ðŸ’¡ Tools & Skills

- **Tools**: Figma, PostHog, Firebase (proposed), SQL (mocked), Canva (UX sketch)
- **Skills**: Funnel Analysis, A/B Testing, User Behavior Mapping, UX Copywriting, Gen Z Emotional Design, Retention Strategy

---

## ðŸ’¡ Takeaway

Early-stage startups like Robyn must prioritize **emotional resonance and product usability** over premature scaling. By making Robyn feel more *human* and reducing onboarding friction, the app can build deeper trust â€” the foundation of any wellness product.
